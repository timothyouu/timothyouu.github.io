### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite because I was able to code a game where
    players would fill in the blanks to make a story also known as a Madlib.
    During this lab, I was able to print out text to the console as well as
    take in the text from the user and store it as a variable. Finally, I
    could print the text on new lines so it would not be overwhelming to the
    user and look aesthetically pleasing.

* Lab 6
  
    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to learn a new card game
    called Black Jack and was able to use the things I learned in the class to
    code a card game. During this lab, I was able to use multiple functions
    with if statements to check if the users input were valid. Finally, I was
    able to tie them together to give users an error message if an invalid
    input was put as well as giving the user their score if there was no
    invalid input.

* Lab 7
  
    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because I was able to code something that will
    be useful and utilized in the outside world. The code is able to tell the
    user if street parking is allowed based on the time, day, and street.
    During this lab, I was able to use multiple if statements that required
    various conditions such as being on a certain day and within a certain time
    on a certain street. Additionally, I was able to make it so that if the
    user typed an invalid input, it would prompt the user with an error
    message.
